## Contributing

### Requesting A Site
1. Search for an existing issue here: https://github.com/nektro/reader/labels/domain_support
2. If none exist, make a new one here: https://github.com/nektro/reader/issues/new
3. Set the title to be the domain.
4. Set the description to be a link to an example article.
5. When approved, it will be tagged with the `domain_support` label and worked on.
6. If further information is required it will recieve the `help wanted` label.

### Bugs
1. Bugs happen too, and please report them if you find them!
2. Search for an existing issue here: https://github.com/nektro/reader/labels/bug
3. If none exist, make a new one here: https://github.com/nektro/reader/issues/new
4. When approved, it will be tagged with the `bug` label and worked on.

### Contributing Code
1. Issues that have been labeled either `domain_support` or `bug` have been confirmed and are ready to work on.
2. If you wish to work on an issue please let others know by posting a message in the comments.
3. I will label issues with `good first issue` as best as I can. The best candidates for this label are domains that are part of a network that has support already added. Adding support for this domain would consist of: adding the domain to the appropriate `switch` statement, and adding the site to the list of supported domains in [`domains.txt`](domains.txt).
